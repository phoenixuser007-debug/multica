## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Keep changes scoped to this directory and follow existing naming and layering patterns.
- Prefer extending existing modules over introducing parallel abstractions without a clear need.

### Testing Requirements
- Run `pnpm typecheck` for TypeScript changes that affect shared types or cross-workspace imports.
- Run the closest Vitest target, or `pnpm test`, when changing UI behavior, hooks, or shared state.

### Common Patterns
- Follow the closest existing local pattern before inventing a new one.
- Prefer small, scoped edits so this directory stays easy to navigate.

## Dependencies
