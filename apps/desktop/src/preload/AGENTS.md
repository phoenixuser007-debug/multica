## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Keep changes scoped to this directory and follow existing naming and layering patterns.
- Prefer extending existing modules over introducing parallel abstractions without a clear need.

### Testing Requirements
- Run the desktop workspace dev or build command after changing Electron process wiring.
- Verify changes across the correct Electron boundary: main, preload, or renderer.

### Common Patterns
- Follow the closest existing local pattern before inventing a new one.
- Prefer small, scoped edits so this directory stays easy to navigate.
